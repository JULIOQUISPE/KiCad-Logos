KiCad-Logos
===========

LAYOUT FILES: Graphical things for KiCad / pcbnew in library form.


Sizes: 1..20mm for most logos.

Layers: silkscreen-front, silkscreen-back, copper-front, copper-back.


The graphics are mirrored for the back-layers. You only have to put the curser above it and 'flip' the footprint by pressing 'f'.
