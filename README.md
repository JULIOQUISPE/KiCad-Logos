===========

LAYOUT FILES: Graphical things for KiCad / pcbnew in library form.

Sizes: 1..20mm for most logos.

Layers: silkscreen-front, silkscreen-back, copper-front, copper-back.


If necessary, the graphics are available in mirrored versions for the back-layers. Once inserted to your board, you only have to hover the curser above it and 'flip' the footprint by pressing 'f'.
